3) Forecasting the market for next-generation biopharmaceuticals such as CAR-T
Cellular therapies can be broadly categorized into immune cell therapies, such as CAR-T cell therapies, and stem cell therapies.
CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen T Cells) cell therapy is a treatment in which T cells are isolated from a patient, genetically engineered to recognize and kill tumors, and then 
infused back into the patient.
         - The market size of          CAR-T is expected to grow rapidly from $72 million in '17 to $1.83 billion by '23, at a CAGR of 71.5
Stem cell therapy is the artificial infusion of stem cells into the body to repair damaged cells and tissues, making it a viable option for treating neurodegenerative diseases 
and repairing damaged organs.
         - Stem cell therapies will grow at a CAGR of 16.5% from $150 million in '17 to reach $3.38 billion in '23

Immuno-oncology treats cancer by stimulating the immune system; classified into active and passive treatments based on body system
Passive therapy involves injecting components of the immune response into cancer patients to treat them.
        - Immune Checkpoint inhibitor , lmmune Cell Thraphy , etc.
Active therapies actively activate an individual's antibodies and immune cells.

Immuno-oncology drugs are drugs that prevent cancer cells from evading the body's immune system or make immune cells 
better able to recognize and attack cancer cells.
Unlike targeted therapies, it does not require a specific target to be used, so it can be applied to many patients.
Because it works through the immune system, it has fewer side effects than traditional cancer drugs.
The global immuno-oncology market is segmented into immunomodulators , anti-cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapies, 
antibody-based targeted therapies, and anti-virals.
Immunomodulators
Anti-cancer vaccines
Adoptive Cell Therapy
Antibody-based targeted therapies
AntiviralIncludes immune gateway inhibitors and other immunomodulators (cytokines, etc.)
T umor-specific antigens from cancer cells are given to cancer patients to activate their immune system.
A  cellular therapy in which the body's own immune cells are harvested, enhanced, genetically modified, and 
reintroduced.
Exploit the properties of antibodies that selectively bind to target antigens
Monoclonal antibodies are designed to bind to specific parts of cancer cells and can be very effective in treating 
cancer .
